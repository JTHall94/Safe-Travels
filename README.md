This is the repo for my Final Project, Safe Travels.

The purpose of the project is to provide an effective and efficient alert system that will allow users to notify other users when they are in potentially dangerous situations by way of preset alarms. If a user is entering a potentially dangerous situation, they can set an alert that contains information for where they are, when they are entering the location, and when they should be back. If not back by the return time, the alert will trigger and notify users who were tagged in its creation. The tagged users will then be able to call the correct authorities.


Documentation for this project as it is being created currently resides in the "documentation" folder. Right now, that folder contains wireframe mockups, and a basic outline of the database structure.
